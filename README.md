# Blockchain-based system for IOT protection

In this repository I added my Bachelor's Thesis work. 
I had to implement a blockchain-based solution for the IOT security that has been presented by this paper:
https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/957785

Since it was not a research thesis and the time was limited, I had to simplify the original model; thus my thesis objective was to exploit the challenges and the problems of implementing such solution using an existing blockchain, more specifically Ethereum.
